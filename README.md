NETLIFY: https://vat-calc.netlify.app/, 

Displays to users a form with two input fields. The form outputs a total of the two input fields, VAT for the total (adjustable rate), and a Grand Total adding the VAT to the subtotal. Rounds accurately with appropriate JavaScript methods, rather than truncating to avoid dodgy decimal handling (we love JavaScript, right?).
